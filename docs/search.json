Some people think that a disability has to be visible to be accommodated. This is not the case. There are many disabilities – diabetes, psychological illness, learning disabilities, AIDS, seizure disorders, arthritis, etc., – that require accommodations. Examples of accommodations include additional testing time; adaptive equipment; and taping of classes. If you feel that you may need a reasonable accommodation based on a disability, please contact the staff at the Office of Disability Services, Newman Vertical Campus, Room 2-271, or by phone at (646) 312-4590."

Baruch students are expected to bear individual responsibility for their work, to learn the rules and definitions that underlie the practice of academic integrity, and to uphold its ideals. Ignorance of the rules is not an acceptable excuse for disobeying them. Any student who attempts to compromise or devalue the academic process will be sanctioned.” Additional information can be found at http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/academic/academic_honesty.html\nStudents caught cheating will first receive a PEN grade and a report of suspected academic dishonesty will be sent to the Office of the Dean of Students. That grade will then be changed to an F grade (on top of the penalty decided by the Office of the Dean of Students)."

We strive to ensure that no student with a disability is discriminated against and that none is denied participation in college programs and activities for lack of reasonable accommodations. Some people think that a disability has to be visible to be accommodated. This is not the case. There are many disabilities – diabetes, psychological illness, learning disabilities, AIDS, seizure disorders, arthritis, etc., – that require accommodations. Examples of accommodations include additional testing time; adaptive equipment; and taping of classes. If you feel that you may need a reasonable accommodation based on a disability, please contact the staff at the Office of Disability Services, Newman Vertical Campus, Room 2-271, or by phone at (646) 312-4590."

    "text": "Academic Integrity\nI fully support Baruch College’s policy on Academic, which states, in part:\n“Academic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Cheating, forgery, plagiarism, and collusion in dishonest acts undermine the college’s educational mission and the students’ personal and intellectual growth. Baruch students are expected to bear individual responsibility for their work, to learn the rules and definitions that underlie the practice of academic integrity, and to uphold its ideals. Ignorance of the rules is not an acceptable excuse for disobeying them. Any student who attempts to compromise or devalue the academic process will be sanctioned.” Additional information can be found at http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/academic/academic_honesty.html\nStudents caught cheating will first receive a PEN grade and a report of suspected academic dishonesty will be sent to the Office of the Dean of Students. That grade will then be changed to an F grade (on top of the penalty decided by the Office of the Dean of Students)."
