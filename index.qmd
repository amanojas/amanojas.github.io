I am a PhD candidate in economics at the CUNY Graduate Center and a junior scholar at the [Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality](https://stonecenter.gc.cuny.edu/people/desai-aman/). My primary research fields are labor economics and applied microeconometrics. In my job market paper, I incorporate dynamic complementarity into the measurement of income inequality of opportunity using supervised machine learning. Additionally, I employ causal inference and machine learning techniques to examine inequality in educational and health opportunities, focusing on the roles of families, markets, and government.
